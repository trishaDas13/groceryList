### A React App for Managing Your Shopping List

## Overview
Grocery Bud is a React application that allows users to create and manage a grocery list. It features the ability to add items to the list, check items off as they're purchased, increase or decrease the quantity of items, and remove items from the list. The app also provides visual feedback to the user through the use of toast notifications.

## Key Features
### Adding Items to the List
To add an item to the list, the user enters the item's name in the input field and clicks the "Add Item" button. The `addItem` function is called when the button is clicked, and it adds the item to the `list` state variable. If the user tries to add an empty item, a toast notification is displayed to indicate that the item cannot be added.
